This report details a synergistic framework leveraging AnythingLLM, Plane.so, and GitHub to create a highly organized and efficient workflow.

#### **AnythingLLM as Your AI Command Center**

AnythingLLM stands as a versatile, open-source AI application engineered to support local Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and sophisticated agentic tools.1 Its fundamental role is to serve as a powerful intermediary, seamlessly connecting preferred LLMs with diverse data sources. This connectivity enables a wide array of AI-powered tasks, including but not limited to question answering, comprehensive document summarization, and in-depth data analysis.2

The inherent flexibility of AnythingLLM is a cornerstone of its utility. It is designed to be highly customizable, capable of integrating with a broad spectrum of LLMs, ranging from locally hosted solutions like Ollama to prominent cloud-based providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, and AWS. Furthermore, it supports various vector databases, allowing for tailored AI solutions.1 This architectural design positions AnythingLLM not merely as a standalone AI chat application but as a central orchestrator within a broader ecosystem. Its lightweight operational footprint reinforces this role, indicating that it is primarily built to manage and coordinate, rather than encapsulate, all complex computational tasks or specialized services.3 This deliberate design choice means AnythingLLM is ideally suited to function as the "brain" of an integrated system, coordinating AI-driven actions across different platforms like Plane.so and GitHub. The emphasis within this manual will be on leveraging AnythingLLM as the primary interface for initiating and managing AI-powered workflows. The inherent adaptability of AnythingLLM also provides a critical advantage: if a particular integration pathway, such as a direct GitHub MCP connection, proves challenging, its flexible design allows for the implementation of alternative, more traditional integration methods to achieve the desired outcomes.

#### **Plane.so as Your Project Tracking Backbone**

Plane.so serves as an open-source project management solution, providing the tools necessary to efficiently create, organize, and track a variety of work items, including tasks, projects, issues, and epics.4 A pivotal feature of Plane.so is its robust REST API, which facilitates programmatic interaction. This API enables external systems, such as AnythingLLM agents, to seamlessly manage projects and issues within Plane.so.5

The presence of a well-defined and structured REST API is a fundamental enabler for automation. This design indicates that Plane.so is built for programmatic interaction, making it an excellent candidate for integration with AI agents. Without such an API, the ability of AI to create or update project data would be severely limited. Consequently, this manual will focus on how to interact with this API, primarily through a custom MCP server, to achieve AI-driven project tracking. This approach also highlights the critical importance of diligent API key management and understanding rate limits to ensure stable and uninterrupted operation.5

#### **GitHub as Your Dynamic Documentation Hub**

GitHub offers powerful version control capabilities, underpinned by Git, alongside collaborative features that are indispensable for managing both source code and documentation.7 It provides native support for Markdown, a straightforward language for formatting plain text, which makes it an optimal choice for crafting and maintaining user manuals.10

GitHub's functionality extends beyond that of a mere code repository; it operates as a robust platform for managing living documentation. Its core version control features—commits, branches, and pull requests—are perfectly aligned with the requirement for a user manual that needs to be "constantly update\[d\] with up to the minute information" \[User Query\]. This capability allows for iterative improvements and ensures the documentation remains current and relevant. Therefore, this manual will underscore GitHub's strengths for dynamic documentation management, not exclusively for code. This sets the stage for an AI-assisted *manual* update workflow, where human intervention, guided by AI-generated content, leverages GitHub's native features.

### **1.2 Benefits of This Integrated System**

## **Chapter 2: Integrating AnythingLLM with Plane.so via MCP Server**

 AI system, encompassing the LLM, embedder, and vector database, can necessitate substantial computational resources. For a Docker-based local setup, resource limitations, especially VRAM, can introduce performance bottlenecks or even lead to agent failures.18 Therefore, it is important to actively monitor system resources, particularly when employing local LLMs. Considering external or cloud-based LLMs, or investing in dedicated GPU hardware, may be necessary if performance degradation is observed. This proactive resource management can mitigate common troubleshooting frustrations during operation.

#### **Key Features for This Workflow**

AnythingLLM provides several features critical to establishing the integrated workflow:

* **AI Agents:** These are LLMs specifically configured with access to a suite of tools, enabling them to execute diverse tasks. Capabilities include web browsing, content scraping, document summarization, and saving files.19 These agents are fundamental to AnythingLLM's ability to interact with external services such as Plane.so.  
* **System Prompt Variables:** AnythingLLM supports the dynamic injection of variables (e.g., {date}, {time}, {user.name}) and custom static variables directly into system prompts.21 This functionality facilitates highly personalized and context-aware AI responses, which are essential for tailoring interactions to specific user needs and operational contexts.  
* **LLM Instruction Block:** Within the framework of agent flows, the LLM instruction block serves as a highly flexible and potent component for delivering precise directives to the LLM.22 This block can leverage variables to dynamically shape the LLM's output, enabling its adaptation to a wide range of tasks and requirements.  
* **API Call Block:** This block empowers agents to execute direct API calls as part of their automated flows.24 It allows for the specification of the URL, HTTP method, headers, and request body, with comprehensive support for dynamic variables. This feature is indispensable for interacting with Plane.so's API, whether for direct data manipulation or for testing the custom MCP server.

#### **Configuration Best Practices**

For the majority of users, particularly those not engaged in deep development, it is advisable to manage AnythingLLM configurations via the intuitive in-app interface.25 This approach simplifies the process and reduces the risk of errors associated with direct manipulation of environment variables. It is important to note that any modifications made to environment variables necessitate a restart of the AnythingLLM service or Docker container for the changes to take effect.25

### **2.2 Plane.so: Your Open-Source Project Tracking Companion**

Assuming Plane.so is already operational within a Docker environment, the subsequent steps focus on configuring its API for integration.

#### **Initial Setup and Accessing the Plane.so API**

Plane.so's API is structured around REST principles, designed to process JSON requests and deliver JSON responses, which simplifies programmatic interactions.5

* **Authentication:** To interact with the Plane.so API, it is mandatory to generate a Personal Access Token (API Key) from the Plane.so account. This token is typically accessible through "Profile Settings" and then "Personal Access Tokens".5 This API key must be securely transmitted in the  
  X-API-Key header of every API request.5 A crucial initial step involves guiding users through the process of generating this API key within Plane.so, with a strong emphasis on maintaining its confidentiality. The key should be treated like a password and never shared or exposed in client-side code.5  
* **Base URL:** For the Plane Cloud API, the standard base URL is https://api.plane.so/.5 In self-hosted Plane.so instances, this URL corresponds to the  
  WEB\_URL environment variable configured during the Docker setup.26  
* **Rate Limits:** Awareness of the Plane.so API's rate limit is essential. It restricts requests to 60 per minute per API key.5 This constraint must be carefully considered when designing AI agents to interact with Plane.so, as exceeding this limit will result in throttling errors, impacting the stability of automated operations.

When an AI agent executes actions involving API calls, it inherently utilizes an API key. If a single, shared API key is employed for all AI-driven operations, it becomes highly susceptible to quickly reaching rate limits, and its compromise presents a significant security vulnerability. Best practices for managing API access in AI contexts, as exemplified by features like Portkey's user-specific API keys and budget limits, underscore the need for careful management.27 Therefore, it is recommended to create a

*dedicated* Plane.so API key specifically for AnythingLLM's agent. This practice enhances security by limiting the potential impact if the key is compromised and facilitates more effective management of API usage. This approach also opens avenues for exploring how AnythingLLM's internal mechanisms, or integrations like Portkey, can further secure and manage this key while adhering to rate limits, thereby ensuring both operational stability and data security.

### **2.3 Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a foundational element for enabling sophisticated AI agent interactions with external systems.

#### **What is MCP?**## **Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Foundation**

Establishing a robust foundation is crucial for the successful integration and operation of AnythingLLM, Plane.so, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This chapter provides a detailed overview of the foundational setup for each component.

### **2.1 AnythingLLM: A Quick Refresher on Your AI Assistant**

AnythingLLM's design prioritizes adaptability and efficiency, making it suitable for a range of deployment scenarios.

#### **System Requirements & Deployment**

AnythingLLM is engineered to be highly customizable and can operate with remarkable efficiency, even on compact hardware such as Raspberry Pis.3 For environments requiring multi-user access or production-grade stability, deploying AnythingLLM on a cloud service using Docker is the recommended approach. This method provides comprehensive control and scalability.16 To simplify deployment, convenient one-click templates are available for platforms like Railway and Render.16 When undertaking a local Docker installation, it is imperative to utilize the

\-v flag to ensure persistent data storage. This prevents the loss of critical data upon container restarts.17 The default access point for the application is typically

http://localhost:3001.17

While AnythingLLM itself can be lightweight, the overall system's resource demands are heavily influenced by the chosen LLM, embedder, and vector database.3 Running large local LLMs on the same machine as AnythingLLM can be resource-intensive, particularly in the absence of a dedicated GPU.3 Furthermore, scaling the AnythingLLM backend horizontally is not advisable when using SQLite, its default database; for more robust and scalable deployments, PostgreSQL is recommended.16 This observation highlights that while AnythingLLM can be a minimal application, the integrate

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source protocol, originally developed by Anthropic, designed to enable seamless integration between Large Language Model (LLM) applications, such as AnythingLLM, and external data sources and tools.28 Its core purpose is to provide a standardized method for LLMs to access and interact with the contextual information and external functionalities they require. This is crucial for applications ranging from AI-powered Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to enhanced chat interfaces and complex custom AI workflows.28

MCP establishes a common interface for an LLM to interact with a tool, allowing model creators to train their models on the MCP specification.13 It also adds a "conversational layer" that renders traditional APIs "LLM-friendly".12 Before MCP, LLM tool calling was often bespoke and inconsistent across different models and applications. MCP aims to establish a universal interface standard for LLMs to interact with external systems. This standardization significantly reduces the development overhead and complexity associated with engineering tool interfaces for various LLMs. This standardization is precisely why MCP is the preferred and most robust method for AnythingLLM to interact with Plane.so. It makes the integration more reliable and less prone to issues such as "hallucinating a tool call," which can occur with less structured direct API calls within LLM prompts.18 MCP is thus a key enabler for building reliable and predictable AI agent actions.

#### **How MCP Servers Work with AnythingLLM**

MCP Servers are integrated into AnythingLLM by modifying the anythingllm\_mcp\_servers.json configuration file, located in the AnythingLLM storage plugins directory.28 AnythingLLM automatically detects these configured MCP Servers and initiates them as required. Alternatively, their status (reload, view status, start/stop, view available tools) can be managed directly through the AnythingLLM user interface, specifically on the "Settings \-\> Agent Skills" page.28

It is important to note that MCP servers are not automatically launched when the AnythingLLM application starts. This design choice is implemented to prevent resource overloading during boot-up. Instead, they are activated when the "Agent Skills" page is accessed in the AnythingLLM UI or when an @agent directive is invoked within a chat session.29 Subsequent activations are typically much faster as the MCP servers will already be running in the background.

MCP supports various Transport Types:

* **StdIO:** This is the default and simplest transport type, functioning as a text-based protocol. It requires the command field to be explicitly set in the configuration.28  
* **SSE & Streamable:** These are alternative transport types commonly employed by MCP servers for streaming responses. Their configuration necessitates that the url field be set.28

A critical requirement for any MCP Server command to function correctly is that the respective command or executable *must be installed on the host machine* and accessible within the system's PATH.29 AnythingLLM does not automatically install these dependencies. Users must ensure these prerequisites are met manually. For resource management, an MCP server can be prevented from starting automatically by setting

anythingllm.autoStart: false within its configuration in the anythingllm\_mcp\_servers.json file.28
